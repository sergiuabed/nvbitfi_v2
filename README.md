# NVBitFI for PCAHyperspectralClassifier

This repository contains the code for conducting the analysis presented in the paper **Analysis and Mitigation of Soft-errors in GPU-accelerated Hyperspectral Image Classifiers**.

The HSI classifier tested in this work is [PCAHyperspectralClassifier](https://github.com/gigernau/PCAHyperspectralClassifier/tree/main).

The fault injection tool used is [NVBitFI](https://github.com/NVlabs/nvbitfi). Refer to [this]() (LINK TO WEBTHESIS PENDING) document for a detailed explanation for setting up NVBitFI to perform transient fault injections on the HSI classifier.
